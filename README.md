# Navigating Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adults: A Comprehensive Analysis
This repository contains the code, analysis, and findings for the project titled "Navigating Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adults: A Comprehensive Analysis", completed as part of the B.Sc. in Data Science at SVKMâ€™s NMIMS University.

# Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally and increasingly affect young adults. This study aims to explore and analyze the key risk factors associated with CVDs among adults using statistical and machine learning techniques.

# Objectives
Identify key risk factors (age, gender, BMI, etc.) associated with CVD.

Analyze gender and age group variations in CVD prevalence.

Perform statistical tests and regression modeling to determine relationships and predictive factors.

# Methodologies Used
General Linear Regression (GLM)

Descriptive Statistics

Correlation and Chi-Square Test

Independent Sample T-Test

Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

# Datasets
Kaggle Cardiovascular Dataset

13 variables, 10,273 records

Attributes: Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose, Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity, BMI, CVD presence

Hospital Dataset

Real-world data (22 entries)

Includes stress, diet, medication, and outcomes

# Key Findings
Risk Factors: Older age, male gender, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, and physical inactivity were strongly associated with CVD.

BMI & Weight: Strong positive correlation.

Gender Trends: Females had a slightly higher CVD count.

Activity Levels: Inactivity linked to higher CVD prevalence.

T-Tests: Showed gender differences in stress and alcohol-related variables.

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Jupyter, Spyder, Google Colab)

R (GLM modeling)

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats

# Literature Support
The project is supported by global and Indian studies highlighting the rising burden of CVD, particularly in low-to-middle income countries and among young adults. Studies also emphasized the role of lifestyle, mental health, and the need for early detection.

# Conclusion
This study highlights the importance of early detection and intervention among adults who are typically not perceived as at high risk. By identifying critical risk factors and using both statistical and machine learning techniques, this project lays a foundation for public health strategies and future research.
